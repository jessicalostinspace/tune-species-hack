# Virtual Reality Petting Zoo with Swift + Google Cardboard
This virtual reality petting zoo app was built during Tune's Women's Hackathon. The purpose of it was to allow users the ability to be immersed in wildlife environments and interact with endangered species, given their current plight, in hopes of spreading awareness and protection through wildlife and environmental education. 

The project utilizes a port of [Google's Cardboard SDK](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/) to Swift and iOS. It is inspired by a [Java decompilation](https://github.com/rsanchezsaez/cardboard-java) and [C++ port](https://github.com/rsanchezsaez/CardboardSDK-iOS) by [Ricardo Sánchez-Sáez](https://github.com/rsanchezsaez).

The corresponding ExpressJS back-end used for a UIWebview can be found at [Tune Hack ExpressJS Backend](https://github.com/jessicalostinspace/tune-hack-mean).
